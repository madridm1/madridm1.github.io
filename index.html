            I enjoy both front end and back end development, especially when it comes to bringing pages to life using JavaScript, React.js or jQuery. I also do not shy away when it comes to using MongoDB, Node.js, MySQL or other back end technologies.

            I am a motivated self-starter, with 27 years of experience working in teams and individually as a field service electronics technician. I enjoyed fourteen years working on business machines, three years maintaining and repairing traffic signal controls and the rest of my career designing, installing and repairing security systems and access control. I look forward to a new career as a developer bringing the same drive and dedication that I have as a technician.

            I am a dedicated family man with a strong work ethic. We love to hike and explore as a family. I like to play trumpet and am a member of the "Mormon Battalion Band". I enjoy working with my hands, wether it's fixing a car or handy work around the house, I love to fix things.
